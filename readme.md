A very basic idea of how this would look like. Lame filters and colors. See: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/952/gfs/index.html

"How do I use prefixes" would link to:

1. Where all prefixes occur (css properties, values, DOM interfaces). 
2. How to use modernizr's prefix-returning function for use in your script.
3. A reduced snippet from there?
4. Graceful degradation guidelines
5. Link to Tantek wiki page on why we have prefixes (and when we wont have them).


"Tools for Feature Support":

1. Css3please.com
2. modernizr polyfill wiki
3. modernizr
4. CSS Preprocessors? 
5. caniuse.com?

To do
------
1. Make this list a JSON?
2. Get used by stats from caniuse.com
3. Fix the filters to work simultaneously.
4. Add more info for each "feature" (e.g. selectors should list all selectors, possibly accessed with a "view more" or smthing).
5. Link to Paul Irish's post on responsible polyfilling.
