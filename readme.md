A very basic idea of how this would look like. Lame filters and colors. 

= To do =
1. Make this list a JSON?
2. Get used by stats from caniuse.com
3. Fix the filters to work simultaneously.
4. Add more info for each "feature" (e.g. selectors should list all selectors, possibly accessed with a "view more" or smthing).
