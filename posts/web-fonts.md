Use the [Font Squirrel Generator](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator) for fonts you have license for using as web fonts. [Font Squirrel @font-face syntax](http://www.fontspring.com/blog/the-new-bulletproof-font-face-syntax) is also the most bullet-proof way of serving web fonts. You do not need polyfills - just fonts in several formats.
