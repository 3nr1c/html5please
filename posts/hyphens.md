CSS3 lets you break words using hyphens. As it does not make text unreadable on browsers which do not support this feature, we recommend you use it without any polyfills or fallbacks. [CSS Hyphenator](http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/) is a polyfill that works on browsers that support the soft hyphen.
